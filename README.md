    <h2>Well posed learning problems</h2>
    <p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E in context to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as was measured by P, upgrades with experience E.</p>

                <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
                <p>Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.
                After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data.</p>

                    <li>Naive Bayes Classifiers</li>
                    <li>K-NN (k nearest neighbors)</li>
                    <li>Decision Trees</li>

                <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
                <p>Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data.</p>

                <h2>Reinforcement learning</h2>
                <p>Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.
                    It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.
                    Reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.</p>
